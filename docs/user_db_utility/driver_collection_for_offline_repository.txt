Official Microsoft Sources:
1. Windows Update / Microsoft Update Catalog

URL: https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/
This is Microsoft's official driver repository
Contains drivers that have passed Microsoft's certification (WHQL - Windows Hardware Quality Labs)
Searchable by hardware ID, product name, or KB number
Most reliable source but doesn't contain every driver ever made

2. Windows Driver Store (Local)

Location: C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository
Windows maintains a local cache of installed and staged drivers
This is where Windows pulls drivers from when installing new hardware

Third-Party Driver Repositories:
3. Station-Drivers.com

Large collection of drivers from various manufacturers
Organized by category and manufacturer
Updates regularly but not comprehensive

4. DriverPack Solution

https://drp.su/
Large offline driver database
Popular for system builders and IT professionals
Contains massive driver pack collections

5. Snappy Driver Installer

Open-source driver updater tool
Maintains large driver index database
Can download driver packs for offline use

Why No Single Repository Exists:

Proprietary ownership - Manufacturers own their drivers and control distribution
Licensing restrictions - Not all drivers can be legally redistributed
Sheer volume - Millions of hardware devices exist with multiple driver versions each
Update frequency - New drivers released constantly
Hardware ID complexity - Same device may need different drivers for different OS versions

Best Practices for Driver Management:
For building a comprehensive driver database, you'd need to:

Pull from Windows Update Catalog (Microsoft's official)
Scrape manufacturer websites (Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS, etc.)
Use third-party aggregators as supplementary sources
Maintain hardware ID to driver mappings
Track driver versions and compatibility matrices
