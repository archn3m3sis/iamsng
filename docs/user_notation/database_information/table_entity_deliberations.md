  ---

  **Option A: Reference role_id (Recommended)**
  ‚úÖ Benefits:
  - No data repetition - Role name stored once in role table
  - Easier updates - Change role name in one place, all users automatically see new name
  - Better performance - Integer comparisons faster than string comparisons
  - Smaller storage - Integer (4-8 bytes) vs string (potentially 50+ bytes per row)
  - Standard practice - Following normalized database design

  **‚ùå Drawbacks:**
  - Requires JOIN to see role name in queries
  - Less readable in raw database views

  **Option B: Reference role_name**
  ‚úÖ Benefits:
  - Human readable - Can see role directly without JOIN
  - Simpler queries for basic selects

  **‚ùå Drawbacks:**
  - Data repetition - If you have 1000 users with "Administrator" role, that string is stored 1000 times
  - Update complexity - Changing a role name requires updating every user record
  - Risk of inconsistency - Typos or case differences ("Admin" vs "admin")
  - More storage - Significantly larger database size
  - Violates normalization - Goes against your requirement of minimal data repetition

>[!Quote] For the user table, we will be referencing the role.role_id field with our foreign key reference....

##### **USER TABLE FIELD CONSIDERATIONS WITH SECURITY IN MIND:**
  ---
  **Potentially Useful CAC Fields:**
  1. `user_piv_auth_cert_hash` - Hash of PIV authentication certificate (for certificate pinning) [add]
  2. `user_affiliation` - Military branch/civilian agency (ARMY, NAVY, USAF, etc.) [add]
  3. `user_person_designator` - Civilian/Military/Contractor status [add] 
  4. `user_cac_expiry` - Certificate expiration date (for proactive renewal) [add] 
  5. `user_alternate_token` - Backup authentication method if CAC unavailable [add] 

  My recommendation: Add at minimum user_affiliation and user_cac_expiry for better user management.

  **Audit Fields Explanation:**
  *What are audit fields?*
  Fields that automatically track WHO did WHAT and WHEN:
  - `created_at` - Timestamp when record was created
  - `created_by` - User ID who created the record
  - `modified_at` - Timestamp of last modification
  - `modified_by` - User ID who last modified it
  - `version` - Record version number (for optimistic locking)

  ***Are they REQUIRED for FIPS 140-3/DoD?***
  - **YES** - DoD RMF (Risk Management Framework) and *NIST 800-53 require audit trails*
  - **FIPS 140-3**: **Section 7.9 mandates** "*audit mechanism* for *security-relevant events*"
  - **STIG Requirements**: Application *must log user activities, especially privilege changes*


**Fields I want to add to the table:** 
- user_piv_auth_cert_hash
- user_affiliation 
- user_person_designator
- user_cac_expiry
- created_at
- created_by
- modified_at
- modified_by
- version

**Prior to pushing the addition of these fields, could you tell me:** 
- What is optimistic locking in the context of the verion field for the user table? 
- What is certificate pinning and how does the inclusion of the user_piv_auth_cert_hash facilitate this within a dataabase app authenticatijon? 


##### **OPTIMISTIC LOCKING & CERTIFICATE PINNING EXPLAINED**
---
**Optimistic Locking with Version Field:**
- What it is:
  *A strategy to ==prevent conflicts when multiple users edit the same record simultaneously WITHOUT locking the database row==.*

- How it works:
  -- User A loads record: SELECT * FROM user WHERE user_id = 1
  -- Record has version = 5

  -- User B loads same record simultaneously
  -- Also sees version = 5

  -- User A updates:
  
  ```
  UPDATE user
  SET user_email = 'new@email.com', version = 6
  WHERE user_id = 1 AND version = 5
  ```
  
  -- Success! 1 row affected

  -- User B tries to update:

 ```
  UPDATE user
  SET user_phone = '555-1234', version = 6
  WHERE user_id = 1 AND version = 5 
 ``` 
 
 -- FAILS! 0 rows affected (version is now 6, not 5)
  **-- ==Application detects failure and can reload/retry==**

  Benefits for DoD:
  - **Prevents data corruption** in high-concurrency environments
  - **No database locks** = ***better performance***
  - **Audit trail** shows all attempts
  - ***Required for many government systems***

##### **CERTIFICATE PINNING USING `USER_PIV_AUTH_CERT_HASH`**
---
**What it is:**
- ***Security technique that "pins" (associates) a specific certificate with a user, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks*** ==even if a Certificate Authority is compromised.==

**How it works in our app:**
// During CAC authentication:
  1. User presents CAC certificate
  2. Calculate hash: `SHA256(certificate)`
  3. Compare with stored `user_piv_auth_cert_hash`
  4. If match = trusted certificate
  5. If no match = potential security issue

**// First login:**
- if (user.user_piv_auth_cert_hash == null) {
      // Store the hash for future pinning
      user.user_piv_auth_cert_hash = CalculateHash(cacCertificate);
  }

**// Subsequent logins:**
  else if (user.user_piv_auth_cert_hash != CalculateHash(cacCertificate)) {
      // ALERT: Certificate changed unexpectedly!
      // Could be: reissued CAC, compromised cert, or attack
      LogSecurityEvent();
      RequireAdminApproval();
  }

**Benefits for DoD:**
  - **Prevents sophisticated attacks** - Even if attackers get a "valid" certificate from compromised CA
  - **Detects CAC cloning attempts** - Each physical CAC has unique certificate
  - **Compliance** - Meets "high assurance" authentication requirements
  - **Audit trail -** Logs when certificates change

> Important consideration: CACs get reissued (every 3 years, or if lost/damaged). When legitimate reissue happens, admin must update the hash.




  **Table: user**
  - user_id (PK, auto-increment)
  - user_first
  - user_last
  - user_email
  - user_phone
  - user_dodid
  - user_certificate_dn
  - user_certificate_serial
  - user_account_status
  - user_last_cac_auth
  - user_requires_cac
  - user_piv_auth_cert_hash
  - user_affiliation
  - user_person_designator
  - user_cac_expiry
  - user_role (FK to role.role_id, NOT NULL)
  - sme_role (FK to sme_role.smerole_id, NULLABLE)
  - created_at
  - created_by
  - modified_at
  - modified_by
  - version

  **Data Type Decisions for Scalability:**
  - *user_dodid: BIGINT (more efficient than VARCHAR, handles 10-digit numbers, indexed faster)*
  - *user_account_status: TINYINT with enum (more efficient than strings, prevents invalid values)*
  - *Timestamps: DATETIMEOFFSET (captures time-zone, crucial for global DoD operations)*


  **Table: role**
  - role_id (PK, auto-increment)
  - role_name
  - created_at
  - created_by
  - modified_at
  - modified_by
  - version
    
  **Table: sme_role**
  - smerole_id (PK, auto-increment)
  - smerole_name
  - created_at
  - created_by
  - modified_at
  - modified_by
  - version


##### **üìö ENTITY VERSUS CONFIGURATION EXPLANATION & SECURITY BEST PRACTICES**
---
  What I Mean by "Entities Created but Configurations Not":
```
  Entities (what we created):
  // User.cs - This is the C# class that represents the data
  public class User {
      public int UserId { get; set; }
      public string FirstName { get; set; }
      // etc...
  }

  Configuration Classes (what we need):
  // UserConfiguration.cs - This tells EF Core HOW to map the class to the database
  public class UserConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<User> {
      Configure() {
          // Maps UserId to "user_id" column
          // Sets up foreign keys
          // Creates indexes
          // Defines constraints
      }
  }
```

```
  Current Status:
  - ‚úÖ Created: User.cs, Role.cs, SmeRole.cs (the entity classes)
  - ‚úÖ Created: UserConfiguration.cs (tells EF how to create the user table)
  - ‚ùå Missing: RoleConfiguration.cs (needed to properly create role table)
  - ‚ùå Missing: SmeRoleConfiguration.cs (needed to properly create sme_role table)
```

  Without configurations, EF Core will use conventions (which might not match your exact requirements like column names role_id vs
  default RoleId).

##### **INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR AUDIT TRAIL (SYSTEM_USER)**
---
**DoD/NIST Best Practice** - *"Principle of Least Privilege with System Account":*

The industry standard, especially for government systems, is:
  1. ***Create a SYSTEM user (ID = 1) that:***
    - Cannot log in (no CAC, no password)
    - Is used ONLY for system operations
    - Has account_status = SYSTEM (we'd add this status)
    - Shows clear audit trail (not NULL, not ambiguous)
  2. ***Benefits of SYSTEM user approach:***
    - ‚úÖ Clear accountability - Shows "SYSTEM" did it, **not unknown**
    - ‚úÖ STIG compliant - **Satisfies V-222430** (all actions must be attributable)
    - ‚úÖ No nulls - Maintains **referential integrity**
    - ‚úÖ Auditable - Can **track all system operations**
    - ‚úÖ Standard practice - **Used by SQL Server, Oracle, Windows, etc.**
  3. ***Implementation:***
  -- First record in database
  
```sql
INSERT INTO user (user_id, user_first, user_last, user_email, user_dodid, ...)
VALUES (1, 'SYSTEM', 'ACCOUNT', 'system@iamsng.local', 0, ...);
```

  Final Decisions: 
  4. Yes, create the configuration classes for `Role` and `SmeRole` (ensures proper column names and relationships)
  5. Use `SYSTEM user approach` (ID = 1) for audit trail - this is DoD best practice
  6. Add **seed data for**:
    - SYSTEM user (ID = 1)
    - Initial roles (Administrator, Technician, etc.)

	- Maybe one admin user for first login
